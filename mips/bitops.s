#
# this program performs a number of bit operations on the 32-bit word stored
# in the variable number displaying the result of each.
# the manipulations you are supposed to perform are numbered and
# the manipulations given in RTL
# After each manipulation the result is output in hexadecimal.
#
# you should code each manipulation and set number to various bit patterns
# for testing.
#
# at the beginning of each new manipulation, number is loaded into $t0.
# at the end of each manipulation, $t0 is output in hexadecimal with a
# banner indicating what the manipulation did.
#
# the program starts by outputting number in hexadecimal
